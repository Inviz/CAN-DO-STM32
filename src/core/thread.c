/* A generic RTOS task function that handles all typical configurations of threads. It supports following features or combinations of
  them:
  - Waking up devices on individual software timers to simulate delays and periodical work
  - Aborting or speeding up the software timer
  - Broadcasting events to multiple listeners
  - Broadcasting events to first taker
  - Deferring events for later handling if device was busy
  - Maintaining queue of events OR lightweight event event mailbox slot.

  An app has at least five of these threads with different priorities. Devices declare "ticks" which act as callbacks for a corresponding
  thread. This way devices can prioritize parts of their logic to play well in shared environment. For example devices may afford doing
  long-er processing of data in background without fearing of blocking networking or handling inputs for the whole app. Another benefit of
  allowing device to run logic with different priorities is responsiveness and flexibility. An high-priority input event may tell device to
  abort longer task and do something else instead.

  A downside of multiple devices sharing the same thread, is that there is no time-slicing of work within a thread between devices.
  Essentially, until a device finishes its work the whole thread (including processing of new events) is blocked, unless a thread with
  higher priority tells the device to stop. So devices still need to be mindful of blocking the cpu. There can be a few solutions to this:
  - Devices can split their workload into chunks.  Execution control would need to be yielded after executing each chunk by using software
    timer to wake later to execute the next chunk. The downside to this is that each chunk can only be scheduled with resolution of a time
  slice (1ms).
  - Devices can also create their own custom threads with own queues, leveraging all the dispatching and queue-management mechanisms. In
    this case RTOS will use time-slicing to periodically break up execution and allow other threads to work.
